    Description with installation instructions: Drop the pk3 into your base folder and have fun!  I've include a few npc files this time.

		npc spawn n_proxy 		(simple proxy that just stands around).
		npc spawn proxy_maul	(looks like proxy, but acts and sounds like Darth Maul.)
		npc spawn proxy_obi		(looks like proxy, but acts and sounds like Ep III Obi-Wan.)
		
		
	I would recommend replacing the lightsabers with the real Darth Maul and Obi-Wan saber hilts.  I only didn't include them because I've had them so long that I didn't know who to credit for them.  :/
